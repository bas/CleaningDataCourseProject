# CleaningDataCourseProject
This repository is the submission for the Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project.

The assignment is based on the [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones).

To run the script:

- Download and extract the [data set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00240/)
- Source and run the script:

```
source("run_analysis.R")
run_analysis()
```

- The [run_analysis.R](run_analysis.R) script assumes the data set is extracted in `./UCI HAR Dataset`.
- The five assignment steps are included as comments.
- A separate [code book](code-book.md) describes the data and data cleaning and summarizing steps.
